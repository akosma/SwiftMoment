# Contributor Guidelines

So you want to help us making a better SwiftMoment? Thanks! For the sake
of a productive collaboration, please pay attention to the following
collaboration guidelines:

## Pull Requests > Issues

Whenever possible, try to provide us with [pull requests][pr] instead of
simply creating an issue. Pull requests help us move forward faster, and
we will be glad to review and eventually include it in the master
branch.

## Issues

If you open an issue, make sure to include a complete description.
Follow the template that appears on the form, including as much
information as possible. You should include code snippets that helps us
reproduce the error. Saying "it does not work" without further context
does not help anybody.

## Pull Requests

If you create a pull request, please be aware that we only accept pull
requests that include unit tests for your changes. **We do not accept
pull requests without the appropriate unit tests** unless they are just
grammar, cosmetic, documentation or typographical corrections.

Before sending a pull request, make sure that:

1. Your code compiles without warnings of any kind.
2. Your code runs without runtime warnings.
3. You have checked your code with either [SwiftLint][swiftlint] or
   [Tailor][tailor] and you have removed any warnings shown by either of
      these tools.
      4. You have included unit tests for your feature, if required.
      5. All previous unit tests pass.
      6. You have included and/or updated API documentation in the
         public
            methods, structs and classes that are referenced by your
            pull
               request.

## Behaviour

We want SwiftMoment to be an inclusive project. Please be kind and
helpful in your comments. In case of doubt, ask questions. Be honest and
humble. May SwiftMoment be a better place after you have been here :)
